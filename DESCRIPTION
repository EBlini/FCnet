Description: 
  Analysis of Functional Connectivity (FC) data can be daunting due to the large
  dimensionality of the features involved. FCnet provides helper functions 
  to reduce this dimensionality by applying either Principal Components Analysis
  (PCA) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on FC matrices. Then, FCnet 
  acts as a wrapper around 'glmnet' and implements regression methods - i.e.
  elastic nets, thus encompassing Ridge and LASSO frameworks - for robust 
  prediction of (behavioral) scores associated with the matrices. Regression
  models are crossvalidated and prediction performances indices are returned. 
  Utilities for permutation tests, back-projection of the results onto the 
  original space, and plotting are provided as well.
