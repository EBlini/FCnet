Description: The analysis of (Functional Connectivity) neuroimaging data can be 
  daunting due to the very high dimensionality of the features involved. 
  In time, several approaches to the problem have been devised. 
  `FCnet` allows one to easily implement a three steps procedure consisting of: 
  i) Feature reduction: the functional connectivity matrices are first 
  summarized through data reduction techniques such as Principal 
  Component Analysis or Independent Components Analysis. 
  ii) Robust regression: the reduced matrix of Weights is then entered 
  into a robust regression model (with either ridge or LASSO penalty). 
  The model is crossvalidated internally by means of Leave-One-Out (nested) 
  crossvalidation. 
  ii) Back-projection: models' coefficients can be back-projected onto the 
  original space, in order to rank the most predictive edges of a matrix.
