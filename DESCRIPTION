Description: 
This package is a wrapper around 'glmnet' that has been optimized for the analysis of functional connectivity / behavior relationships.
Functional connectivity matrices are typically very large, thus functions are available in order to apply features reduction techniques prior to the regression models. 

Depends: glmnet,
        glmnetUtils

Imports: 
        ggplot2,
        reshape2
