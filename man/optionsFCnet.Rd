\usage{
optionsFCnet(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cv.type.measure}{The measure to minimize in crossvalidation inner loops.
Differently from \code{glmnetUtils::cva.glmnet()} the deafult is the mean absolute error.}

\item{intercept}{whether to fit (TRUE) or not (FALSE) an intercept to the model.}

\item{standardize}{Whether x must be standardized. Differently from
\code{glmnet::glmnet()} the default is FALSE as we assume predictors are already either
summarised with PCA or ICA (and therefore scaled) or drawn from normalized FC matrices.}

\item{whichLambda}{During crossvalidation, either selects "lambda.min" - which
chooses the value of lambda which best minimizes the mean crossvalidation error - or
"lambda.1se" - which "which gives the most regularized model such that error is
within one standard error of the minimum". The latter would be preferable
for stability.}

\item{colorPaletteDefault}{The default color palette for plotting matrices (a vector of colors).}
